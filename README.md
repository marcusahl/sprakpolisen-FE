# sprakpolisen-FE
Frontend for Sprakpolisen


An Angular 2 app built in typescript based on the Angular2 Quickstart and inspired strongly by the Tour of Words.

To build and run the app in dev mode: 

1. Run `npm install` to get all npm dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to get continous transpiling, browser loading and browser refresh. 

While developing, make sure to check 
 a) editor lint warnings
 b) transpiler output in terminal
 c) console output in the browser
